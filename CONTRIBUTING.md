everyone involved.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally
  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/soar.git
  cd soar
  ```
3. **Add the upstream remote**
  ```sh
  git remote add upstream https://github.com/pkgforge/soar.git
  ```

## Development Workflow

1. Create a new branch for your feature or bugfix

2. Make your changes

3. Keep your branch updated with the main branch:
  ```sh
  git pull upstream main --rebase
  ```

## Commit Guidelines

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
specification for our commit messages. This leads to more readable messages
that are easy to follow when looking through the project history.

### Commit Message Format

Each commit message consists of a **header**, a **body** and a **footer**:

```
<type>(<scope>): <short summary>

<body>

<footer>
```

The **header** is mandatory and must conform to the following format (can be
ignored if you expect the commits to be squashed):

- **type**: Describes the kind of change:
  -  `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `build`, `ci`,
    `chore`, `revert`

- **scope**: Can be anything specifying the place of the commit change (e.g., `cli`, `repo`, `package`)

- **summary**: Summary in present tense, not capitalized, no period at the end,
  under 72 characters

### Examples

```
feat(cli): add search filtering by package type
```

```
fix(repo): resolve metadata caching issue

The metadata cache wasn't properly invalidated when repository 
sources changed, leading to stale package information. This fix 
ensures the cache is rebuilt whenever source files are modified.

Fixes #123
```

### Commit Practices to Avoid

- Don't use AI-generated commit messages without review and editing
- Don't make vague commits like "bug fix" or "update"

## Pull Request Process

1. **Ensure your code compiles** before opening a PR
2. **Reference any relevant issues** in your PR description

### Draft Pull Requests

If you have work in progress that you want early feedback on, or if there are known blockers:

1. Open the PR as a **Draft**
2. Clearly mention in the description that it's a work in progress
3. Describe the specific blockers or areas where you need help
4. Convert to a regular PR once ready for final review

## Code Style and Quality

### General Guidelines

- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Document complex algorithms or non-obvious code decisions
- **Avoid AI-generated comments** - we prefer contextual comments over
  boilerplate generated by tools like Cursor or Copilot

### Quality Checks

Before submitting a PR:

1. **Ensure your code compiles** with no warnings
2. Optionally, run `cargo clippy` and address any lints
3. Format your code with `cargo fmt`
